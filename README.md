This is a project for scraping patent files and creating .docx-documents with reports.
I've created it when asked by a relative to help themwith their patent search. I don't know much about patents and the standards of formatting patent reports, so I think the formatting part certainly has errors.
I've also created some functions for parsing chemical composition and topic information but they are by no means complete.

!!!WARNING!!!
this should be used only for non-commercial purposes. Please take into account the fact that parsing HTML pages is not very good for the site-owners. Please tune the settings called PAUSE_SEC in the settings file which denote the pause between requests.
